# Customer-Churn-Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn for a subscription-based business using a dataset that includes customer demographics, service usage, and contract information. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to customer churn and provide strategic recommendations to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## Problem Statement
High customer churn poses a significant challenge for many businesses, impacting profitability and growth. Understanding why customers are leaving and identifying patterns in customer behavior is critical to developing effective retention strategies.

## Project Objectives
- **Analyze customer churn patterns** using SQL and Excel to identify key factors affecting churn.
- **Visualize insights and trends** using Tableau dashboards to help stakeholders understand the results.
- **Map the customer lifecycle** to identify pain points and critical touchpoints in the customer journey.
- **Provide actionable recommendations** to improve customer retention based on the findings.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **SQL**: Data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Excel**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation checks, and report generation.
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards for visualizing churn patterns and customer segments.
- **Process Mapping**: Visualizing the customer lifecycle and identifying pain points.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Acquisition and Cleaning**:
   - Imported a customer churn dataset, cleaned it using Excel, and handled missing values.
   - Stored the cleaned data in a SQL database for further analysis.

2. **Data Analysis and Exploration**:
   - Analyzed key metrics such as churn rate by demographics, contract types, and services.
   - Used SQL queries to filter and segment customers based on risk factors.

3. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Segmented customers based on demographics, contract types, and service usage to identify high-risk groups.
   - Calculated churn risk for each segment and highlighted high-risk patterns.

4. **Process Mapping**:
   - Created a process map of the customer lifecycle, identifying key touchpoints and areas where customers face difficulties.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Developed interactive dashboards in Tableau to present key insights, such as churn rates, monthly charges, and customer segmentation.

6. **Strategic Recommendations**:
   - Summarized findings and developed a strategic plan to reduce churn, including targeted offers and enhanced service quality.


## Recommendations
- **Implement retention offers** for customers with month-to-month contracts, incentivizing them to switch to longer-term contracts.
- **Enhance customer support** services for customers with lower tenure to increase satisfaction and retention.
- **Review and improve payment options** to address issues leading to churn among customers using electronic checks.

## Project Deliverables
- **SQL Scripts**: Data extraction, transformation, and analysis queries.
- **Excel Reports**: Pivot tables, charts, and detailed analysis results.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Visualizations of key insights and customer segments.
- **Process Map**: Customer lifecycle and pain points visualization.
- **Business Strategy Report**: A final report summarizing findings and recommendations.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate **real-time customer feedback analysis** to continuously refine retention strategies.
